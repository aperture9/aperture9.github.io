- title: Spline Sweeper
  description:  <p> The sweep component allows you to quickly generate spline meshes to sweep the given spline. Its not meant to be a complex system for special game logic, rather this is for when you just want to mesh a spline quickly and without effort. </p>
                <p> Just one node is required to call the sweep functionality, and it can run in construction script or at runtime. The mesh cleans itself on each run, so it's fine to call on tick as well, so long as your spline isn't too complex. </p>
                <p> This pack comes with a set of profiles to sweep, but you can add your own easily, they are just 1cm2 meshes with a number of subdivisions to increase smoothness during deformation. </p>

- title: In Game Log Display
  description:    <p> If your like me, you love developing in VR, but really dislike having to take the headset off to check the log, or squinting at the in-game console, this may be the plugin for you. In response to this frustration, here is the VR Log. <p>
                  <p> The VR Log / Blueprint exposed log is a C++ plugin that exposes the system output log to blueprint, and uses a interactive 3D widget to visualise the log. </p>
                  <p> The log supports the system log, and blueprint messages. There's no special nodes required, no changes to your workflow, just use print strings as normal. This plugin taps directly into the GLog and pipes the output to blueprints. </p>
